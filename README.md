# chase-99
Problem statements for the Chase 99 stream of IEEE RAS PESU's treasure hunt (Summer, 2022).

There are a total of four problem statements in this stream.
The PDF files named "Problem_Statement" should be the only files shared with the participants.
The files named "solution" and "circuit" are the solutions to the problem statements, which are going to be used as references during evaluation.
For the participants' submissions, only a link is expected from their side.
